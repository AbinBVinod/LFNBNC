; This function takes the address of a block as input, and returns
; a boolean value indicating whether the block is valid or not.

validate_block:
    ; Verify proof of work
    ; Load the block's header data
    ; Calculate the hash of the header
    ; Check that the hash meets the required difficulty target

    ; Verify previous block reference
    ; Load the current block's previous block hash
    ; Load the previous block from the blockchain
    ; Calculate the hash of the previous block
    ; Compare the calculated hash with the previous block reference in the current block

    ; Verify transaction validity
    ; Load the transactions from the block's body
    ; For each transaction:
        ; Verify that the inputs are valid (i.e. not already spent)
        ; Verify that the outputs are valid (i.e. total output value does not exceed input value)
        ; Verify that the digital signatures are valid (i.e. signed by the correct private key)

    ; If all validation checks pass, return true
    ; Otherwise, return false
